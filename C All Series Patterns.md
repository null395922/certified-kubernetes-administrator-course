# All Series Patterns in C

## Why Series Patterns?

In most of the MNC interview questions such as in **ZOHO** interview questions, **IVTL Infoview** interview questions, **Amazon** interview questions, interview questions, **Infosys** interview questions and even in **Voonik** interview questions, we come across series pattern questions with a probability of 3**:**5. We provide you a most commonly asked series pattern question for your interview preparation using C programming.

We challenge you, the programmer to do all the following series pattern programs using c programming
