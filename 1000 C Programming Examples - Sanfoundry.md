# C Programming Examples

![](https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1000-c-programs-img.png)

C is a general-purpose procedural programming language mainly used for software development such as operating systems, compilers, language interpreters, databases, etc. The main features of C programming are speed and efficiency, modularity, portability, static typing, and extensibility. C programming is the perfect language for beginners to learn programming.

This section contains many examples of C programming, from simple programs to very complex and advanced C programs. These C Programming examples are categorized as data types, array, pointers, matrix, bitwise operations, control flow statements, math functions, file handling, factorial and Fibonacci series, palindrome, strings, searching, Sorting, etc. You can also explore a collection of data structure programs in trees, binary trees, heaps, linked lists, hash tables, graphs, stacks, and queues. Each sample program includes a program description, C code, and program output. All examples have been compiled and tested on Windows and Linux systems.
